 * In case the object must be created, it is created using the creator block,
 * then associated to the object with the given association policy. If
 * releaseAfterCreation is true, the newly created object will be released after
 * it is associated.
 * The return value won't necessarily be the object returned by the creator
 * block (in case for instance the association policy is OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY).
 * Using this method is thread-safe. */
