/* Defined here _and_ in build settings.
 * We previously did not need it in the build settings,
 *  but now we do because we allow force loading the categories in the static version of the xcframework to avoid the need of -ObjC.
 * As this is not needed in the dymamic version of the xcframework, we want not to do it in it.
 * So we need the preprocessor instruction to be defined in the source files to know whether to load the categories or not,
 *  which is done with the build settings, and in eXtenderZ.h in the client code to know which quoting style to use (the define in this file).
 * As an added bonus, clients can know whether the xcframework they are using is static or dynamic using a preprocessor check.
 *
 * Note:
 * We could easily have left the force loading of the categories in the dynamic xcframework.
 * It has _no_ performance impact (it is never called!).
 * The only different AFAIK is the addition of a few symbols. */
