TODO

== Installation
The project is now SPM-compatible, via an `xcframework`. Source SPM-compatibility cannot be provided
AFAICT because the project has a part which does not use ARC, and has a custom modulemap.

Carthage installation should work too.

== Credits
This project was originally created by {frizlab}[François Lamboley] while working at {happn}[happn].
